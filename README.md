## Project Description üìù
Welcome to the Virtual CPU Emulator project! This project aims to build an emulation of a virtual CPU from the ground up, over the span of 10 weeks. Each week we will focus on different tasks to incrementally build and refine our emulator. Made By Bangladeshi Students. üáßüá©

## Course Details üè´
- **Course Name:** Computer Architecture 
- **Course Code:** 3101 
- **Section:** 5D 
- **Department:** Computer Science & Engineering 
- **Instructor:** Vashkar Kar  (Lecturer)
- **Institute:** Northern University of Business & Technology, Khulna
- **Website:** www.nubtkhulna.ac.bd

## Scope üîç
The project will simulate a basic CPU architecture, complete with an instruction set, memory management, and execution pipeline. The emulator will be designed to handle a set of predefined instructions and will be tested using a suite of assembly programs.

## Objective üéØ
The primary objective is to gain a thorough understanding of CPU design and operation by implementing a virtual emulator. This includes:
- Designing an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
- Implementing an assembler to convert assembly code to machine code
- Simulating the execution of machine instructions within the virtual CPU

## Technologies Used üíª
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Version Control:** GitHub
- **Assembler:** Custom assembler for converting assembly code to machine code
- **Development Environment:** Any C++ IDE or text editor with C++
